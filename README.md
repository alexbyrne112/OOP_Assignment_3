# Survive


Oisin and I decided to do a first person shooter game for the end of year OOP assignment.
We Chose to do a survival game were you fend off zombie sort enemies.
these enemies chase you around the map and hurt you if they can touch you.
the concept is the same as other zombie survival game.

Controls:
* mouse: Look
* 'w': Forward
* 's': Backward
* 'a': left
* 'd': right
* right click:  shoot
* left click: Throw grenade
* 'space': jump

There is two vendors in the map. first you have the health vendor. here you can pay points for extra health.
You also have the grenade vendor which allows you to buy more grenades. you start off with 2, so you may need more.
We made this game in Unity C#. it was very good an thought us a lot in terms of making games. Unity makes using polymorphism and 
inheritance a lot easier. when you die you get a menu that allows you to go back to the start menu. and from there you can quit of play again.
theres also an instructions menu.

In the game you spawn in the first room. once youve built up enough money from killing zombies you can purchase enterance into the next room
in two of the rooms there are crates. these crates offer different things for a price of 500.
one crate offers health and one offers 2 grenades. you must find these crates in the rooms.

the assets are mainly downloaded off the unity asset store for free. the particle systems were made by us though.
All in all the game looks quite good. the graphics arent fantastic but they are still good. We are very happy with this project and hope to get a high mark.
