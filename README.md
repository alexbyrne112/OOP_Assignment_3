#Survive


Oisin and I decided to do a first person shooter game for the end of year OOP assignment.
We Chose to do a survival game were you fend off zombie sort enemies.
these enemies chase you around the map and hurt you if they can touch you.
the concept is the same as other zombie survival game.

Controls:
* mouse: Look
* 'w': Forward
* 's': Backward
* 'a': left
* 'd': right
* right click:  shoot
* left click: Throw grenade
* 'space': jump

There is two vendors in the map. first you have the health vendor. here you can pay points for extra health.
You also have the grenade vendor which allows you to buy more grenades. you start off with 2, so you may need more.
We made this game in Unity C#. it was very good an thought us a lot in terms of making games. Unity makes using polymorphism and 
inheritance a lot easier. when you die you get a menu that allows you to go back to the start menu. and from ther you can quit of play again.
theres also an instructions menu.
